<li>Testing Center Details: 電車をご利用の場合、秋葉原駅で下車し昭和通り口改札を背にして正面へ直進し、目の前にある横断歩道を使い昭和通りの向かい側へ渡ってください。渡ったら右を向き、昭和通り（高速道路）を右手に見ながら三菱東京UFJ銀行を通り過ぎ80mほど直進します。左側に東京メトロ日比谷線の４番出口がある角を左折してください。70mほど先の右手にある１階に楽器のイケベが入ったビルの3階がテストセンターになります。駐車場には限りがございます。1時間1200円からとなっております。 If taking the train, upon leaving the Showa-dori wicket of Akihabara Station, go straight 100 meters south east across the Showa-dori in front of the ticket gate. Proceed 50 meters and turn left in front of the Kanda River. The testing center is near the musical instrument store called Ikebe. Parking is limited and some distance away. Parking cost can be from $12 per hour.</li>
