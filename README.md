Let’s talk about human nature. Criminals have learned they can exploit typical human emotions and reactions to steal credentials and infiltrate your network.
Fear (Lo sợ)
“If you don’t give me the information, I will report you to your manager.”

Trust
Authentic-looking email from your bank: “Your account has just been closed. Click here to reactivate.”

Morality
“Can you hold that office door open for me? My arm’s broken, and this package is heavy.”

Rewards
“My company is considering investing in your products. Can you answer a few questions about your organization first?”

Conformity
“Bill Stevens from Finance always gives me updates about Q2 earning, but I can’t get a hold of him. Can you help me with the report?”

Curiosity
“Wow… Check out this video of a giant snake eating a zookeeper!”
